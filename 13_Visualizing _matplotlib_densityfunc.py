# Statistics is fundamentally about taking samples of data and using

# If we have enough samples, we can calculate something called a probability 
# density function, which estimates the distribution of grades for the full population.

# Samples refer to the data we have on hand, such as information about these 22
#  students' study habits and grades. The population refers to all possible data 
# we could collect, such as every student's grades and study habits across every 
# educational institution throughout the history of time. Usually we're interested 
# in the population, but it's simply not practical to collect all of that data. 
# Instead, we need to try estimate what the population is like from the small amount 
# of data (samples) that we have.

# In this exercise, we estimated what the population of grades might look like
# from a sample of grades.
